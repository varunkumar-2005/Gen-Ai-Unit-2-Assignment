            "\"Echoes of Eternity\" follows Dr. Emma Taylor, a brilliant physicist who has devoted her life to unlocking the secrets of time travel. When she finally succeeds in creating a stable wormhole, she is faced with an unexpected consequence: her past self has also created a similar wormhole, but with a catastrophic twist. As Emma navigates the blurred lines between her past and present, she finds herself torn between her long-lost love, Jack, who died in a tragic accident five years ago, and a charming stranger, Max, who is drawn to her in the present. But as the two wormholes begin to collide, a malevolent entity from ancient mythology is unleashed, hunting Emma and Max across different eras, forcing them to confront their darkest fears and make impossible choices to survive and unravel the mystery of the interconnected timelines.\n"
